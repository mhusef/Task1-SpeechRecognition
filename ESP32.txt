AlgorithmS(ESP32){

  1- Install Arduino IDE (link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/donate);
     /* Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on 
     easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able 
     to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, 
     or a Twitter message - and turn it into an
      output - activating a motor, turning 
      on an LED, publishing something online. */

  2- Click File then Prefernces and paste this link in Additional Board Manager URLs: (https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json);
     /* This library is need to install ESP32 Board*/ 

  3- Click Tools then Board Manager and search for esp32 install last version it will take a few miuntes;

  4- Click Tools/Board/ESP32 Arduino/WEMOS D1 MINI ESO32;
     /* In this step we connect the ESP32 divice to the our coputer.
      The list provide many type but in our case we us ESP32 Arduino/WEMOS D1 MINI ESO32. */ 

  5- Click Tools/Port/COM4;
    /* here we just select the port connect with ESP32*/
   
  6- Choose an example by select file/Exambles/Basics/Blink (Blink : to test the pice). 
    Blink code :
      void setup() {
        // initialize digital pin LED-BUILTIN as output.
        pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
      }

      //  the loop function runs over again forever
      void loop() {
        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);    // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
        delay(1000);                        // wait forr a second 
        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);     // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
        delay(1000);                        // wait for a second
        /* We can manipulate the speed of led light  by change the delay */
      }
  7- Click Upload icpn to run the cod in ESP32 device.
